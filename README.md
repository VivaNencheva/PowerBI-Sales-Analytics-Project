# PowerBI-Sales-Analytics-Project
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from the AdventureWorks dataset to uncover actionable business insights. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights key metrics such as revenue trends, product performance, customer segmentation, and regional sales analysis. The dashboard features intuitive visualizations, drill-down capabilities, and real-time filtering to enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically. This project demonstrates my abilty in data modeling, visualization design, and storytelling with data to support informed decision-making.
